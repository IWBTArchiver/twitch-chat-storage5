In some ways Nogard&#39;s run is a little better, I think. With the new skips he could beat this easily.  Run is pretty likely to go sub-30, I think.\nThere were a handful of pretty big mistakes that cost this run the 30:xx, and some other sloppiness. It&#39;s a very solid run though","chapters":[{"id":"","startMilliseconds":0,"lengthMilliseconds":2328000,"type":"GAME_CHANGE","description":"I Wanna Be the Guy","subDescription":"","thumbnailUrl":null,"gameId":"20716","gameDisplayName":"I Wanna Be the Guy","gameBoxArtUrl":"https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/ttv-boxart/20716_IGDB-40x53.jpg"}],"streamer":{"name":"GeoGeo222","login":"geogeo222","id":40531267}},"embedded_data":{"twitch_badges":{}},"messages":[]}
